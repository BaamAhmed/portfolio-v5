The concept of "activation energy" is one borrowed from Chemistry, where it defines the energy needed to kickstart a reaction, kind of like pushing a shopping cart over a hill. 

Surprisingly, it translates pretty well to life in general. In a nutshell, it's usually easier to keep doing something than it is to start something new. Ever stare at a blank page when you sit down to write an essay, and the words just don't come? Or when you sit down to study, and the equations make zero sense?

In keeping with that spirit, this essay is sort of like a shitty first draft. Since I want to start writing, and I know that it's easier to continue rather than start, I'm writing this very brief, almost trivial essay which will be the very first essay on my new portfolio website. 

Hopefully, the next few ones come more naturally.
